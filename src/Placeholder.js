If you need to write some code, we've got you covered:
\`<h1>Hello World!</h1><br>\`

What's that? You want to create some block code? Sorted:

\`\`\`
function(answer){
   if (answer === 42){
      return "DON\'T PANIC"
   }
}
\`\`\`

You know all those things? Put them in a list:
- things
- stuff
- other stuff

Rank your favourite words
1. absquatulate
1. antidisestablishmentarianism
1. discombobulate

Use a block quote to emphasise the meaningful things you have to say:
> Curiosity killed the cat,
> so don't be curious
> or your cat will die

You can also get the dummy's attention with **BOLD TEXT**.

##### Of course, as always, people just super like cats:
